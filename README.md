Instructions for using scripts:

1. Copy the script you want to use
2. Bookmark a random page
3. Edit the URL of the bookmark to the copied code
4. Give the bookmark a descriptive name (so that you know what it does)
5. Execute the script by clicking on the bookmark that contains it

If you are on a computer, you can also paste these scripts directly into the console in your browser's developer tools

Scripts must be executed on the screen with the start button for the game (do not press the start button yourself)
